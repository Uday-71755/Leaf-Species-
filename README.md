# Leaf-Species-
Leaf Iris Species Detection through Decision Tree Algorithm. We will begin by utilizing an iris dataset that includes information about plant leaves, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width measured in centimeters. This dataset will allow us to define the shape of the leaves and provide a comprehensive description of the data. Subsequently, we will separate the dataset into input and output variables, followed by dividing it into training and testing sets. Our next step will involve determining the optimal maximum depth value based on the accuracy score and creating a graph to illustrate the relationship between them. Afterward, we will conduct the training process and execute the predictions. Finally, we will assess the model's accuracy based on the predictions obtained.
